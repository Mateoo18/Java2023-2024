# Simulation Game
In this game we simulate the behaviours of the animals. I create Hunter(tiger), Bird and Vegan. 
The tiger hunts on the other animals. It has a vision that enables seeing bird and vegan in distinct of 3 squares. If tiger sees any animal, tiger can jump to it. The tiger takes 15 points of the  energy from the animals.
The bird can fly 3 squares away. It can also bite other animals taking 5 energy.
The vegan is able to heal and brings back the energy of 6. It can  bite other animals taking 2 energy.
